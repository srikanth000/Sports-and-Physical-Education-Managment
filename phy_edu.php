  <h2>Yoga</h2>
    <p class="text">
                        The origins of yoga are a matter of debate.[67] There is no consensus on its chronology or specific origin other than that yoga developed in ancient India. Suggested origins are the Indus Valley Civilization (3300–1900 BCE)[68] and pre-Vedic Eastern states of India,[69] the Vedic period (1500–500 BCE), and the śramaṇa movement.[70] According to Gavin Flood, continuities may exist between those various traditions:<br>

    [T]his dichotomization is too simplistic, for continuities can undoubtedly be found between renunciation and vedic Brahmanism, while elements from non-Brahmanical, Sramana traditions also played an important part in the formation of the renunciate ideal.[71][note 6]<br>

Pre-philosophical speculations of yoga begin to emerge in the texts of c. 500–200 BCE. Between 200 BCE–500 CE philosophical schools of Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism were taking form and a coherent philosophical system of yoga began to emerge.[73] The Middle Ages saw the development of many satellite traditions of yoga. Yoga came to the attention of an educated western public in the mid 19th century along with other topics of Indian philosophy. </p>

 There is no right or wrong defination to <br>meditation. what is true to meditations is that <br>it puts you in contact with your inner and <br>higher self,the part of you that is directly<br> connected with God.

  <h2>Asanas</h2>
      <p class="text">In yoga, asana refers both to the place in which a practitioner (yogi if male, yogini if female) sits and the posture in which he or she sits.[1] In the Yoga Sutras, Patanjali defines "asana" as "to be seated in a position that is firm, but relaxed".[2] Patanjali mentions the ability to sit for extended periods as one of the eight limbs of his system, known as ashtanga yoga.[3]

Asanas are also performed as physical exercise where they are sometimes referred to as "yoga postures" or "yoga positions".[4] Some asanas are arguably performed by many practitioners just for health purposes. Asanas do promote good health, although in different ways compared to physical exercises, "placing the physical body in positions that cultivate also awareness, relaxation and concentration".[5]</p>
